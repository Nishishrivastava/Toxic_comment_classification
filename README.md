# Toxic_comment_classification
The background for the problem originates
from the multitude of online forums, where-in
people participate actively and make
comments. As the comments some times
may be abusive, insulting or even hate-based,
it becomes the responsibility of the hosting
organizations to ensure that these
conversations are not of negative type. The
task was thus to build a model which could
make prediction to classify the comments into
various categories.
